## Express Timestamp Microservice

This is a back-end project created using Node with Express, and a minimal front end interface added with Pug. Originally the user stories came from the Free Code Camp project here:

Originally the specifications only have the capability of passing parameters as part of a URL, but I chose to create a basic form to make the user experience a bit less awkward (though passing parameters works just as well). The current version can be seen as an interactive demo here:
